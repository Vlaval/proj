                            <h3 class="faq-mid-title">What is Emotiq?</h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>Emotiq is a next-generation blockchain with powerful scalability and privacy, combining the latest research in distributed ledger technology with an innovative natural-language approach to smart contracts. Emotiq was founded by Joel Reymont – the ex CTO of Aeternity – in late 2017, after he envisioned a blockchain that takes the very latest techniques for scaling, privacy, and accessibility, and combines them all into the very first blockchain that provides real-world usability for everybody.</p>
                                <p>More specifically, Emotiq introduces horizontal scaling through sharding, zero-knowledge proofs (Bulletproofs) for transaction privacy, and Ring – a plain English smart contract language that allows non-programmers to interact with the blockchain. Emotiq is developed by a team of heavy-duty developers and experts, sourced from across the globe, united in the aim to deliver a private and scalable blockchain that is fit for enterprise and usable by the mass market.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <ul id="faq-list" class="faq-list">
                            <li class="faq-list--item content-article">
                                <h4 class="faq-list--toggle">What problems can Emotiq solve?</h4>
                                <div class="faq-list--item-content">
                                    <p>There are three fundamental problems that no blockchain has managed to solve: scalability, privacy, and accessibility. Some blockchains address one of the aforementioned issues, very few attempt two, and so far none have achieved the trifecta necessary to light the fuse of wide scale adoption. Until now. Emotiq takes a holistic approach and finally solves the ultimate problem: how to make a blockchain that truly works.</p>
                                    <p>One of blockchain’s biggest problems is scalability. Through sharding, Emotiq will be able to scale effectively to handle the large transaction loads needed by businesses which demand proven and consistent performance under all network loads, not just under optimal conditions.  Networks that cannot scale also cannot be relied upon by serious enterprises that don’t want their systems and customers disrupted by the latest animal-related dApps.</p>
                                    <p>Addressing the problem of privacy, Emotiq ensures that transaction amounts are completely hidden from public view, free from snooping eyes, ensuring that your business stays your business and nobody else’s.</p>
                                    <p>Finally, Emotiq, through its innovative Ring smart contract language, solves the problem of accessibility.  No longer will blockchain functionality and integration be open only to those who know how to code.  Using a natural language approach, Ring will make Emotiq accessible not only to those who can already code, but also to “regular people” and those not currently served by existing smart contract languages.</p>
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li class="faq-list--item content-article">
                                <h4 class="faq-list--toggle">Why do we need another blockchain?  Why not just improve Ethereum?</h4>
                                <div class="faq-list--item-content">
                                    <p>To put it simply, because there isn’t yet a blockchain that is up to the task. The large chains - Bitcoin and Ethereum - are slow and lack efficiency, speed, and functionality. And the approach taken by most blockchains is to focus on solving one problem, rather than taking the approach that there are numerous problems to be addressed before real-world utility will be achieved.</p>
                                    <p>So why not improve what’s already there? Improving Ethereum is not a simple task; it’s a complex, established system that can’t be fundamentally be redesigned. Altering Ethereum is like changing course in an ocean-going oil tanker: it takes forever. Adding features such as sharding and better privacy protection can only be done on an “aftermarket” basis, and are features bolted on rather than incorporated into the design from the very beginning. As such, any solutions are extremely complicated and compromised due to issues of backward compatibility. Even if it was possible to modify Ethereum to give it acceptable performance, progress is hampered by the bureaucracy inherent in large organizations. Getting everybody to agree on the best way forward takes months, if not years. Emotiq, in contrast, is a small and dynamic company that can make decisions quickly and act with enough speed to stay ahead of the curve, in addition to working from a completely blank sheet and building a blockchain that incorporates the very latest technology into its DNA.</p>
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li class="faq-list--item content-article">
                                <h4 class="faq-list--toggle">Who are Emotiq’s competitors? What makes Emotiq stand out?</h4>
                                <div class="faq-list--item-content">
                                    <p>Without sounding immodest, there are few direct competitors. Existing blockchains are simply not fit for purpose. Newer chains in development today - the likes of Zilliqa, for example, often cited as a competitor of Emotiq due to its scalability through sharding - does not address the need for privacy and accessibility, and thus is an incomplete solution from the very beginning, and a niche solution at best. Our true competitors are only those blockchains that aim to solve the problems of scalability, privacy, and accessibility. There are none of any note.</p>

                                <h4 class="faq-list--toggle">So how does Emotiq scale, and why is it important?</h4>
                                <div class="faq-list--item-content">
                                    <p>Emotiq uses sharding for its scalability needs. Traditional blockchains based upon Proof-of-Work “scale” by throwing more and more computing power into the nodes in a process called “vertical scalability”. Emotiq is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain that uses scalable and bias-resistant distributed randomness to select the “minter” of each block. Proof-of-Work is expensive, wasteful, leads to centralization (because only large organizations can afford to play), and the speed of the network decreases as it grows larger unless large investments are made in network infrastructure. Sharding, on the other hand, is a form of “horizontal scalability” whereby the transaction load is split into numerous different shards made up of subsets of the total number of nodes in the network and operating independently without compromising integrity.</p>
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li class="faq-list--item content-article">
                                <h4 class="faq-list--toggle">Is Emotiq a public blockchain?</h4>
                                <div class="faq-list--item-content">
                                    <p>Absolutely.  Emotiq is not a private or “permissioned” blockchain and is accessible to anybody who wishes to use it for any purpose.</p>
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li class="faq-list--item content-article">
                                <h4 class="faq-list--toggle">Is Emotiq open source?</h4>
                                <div class="faq-list--item-content">
                                    <p>We only do open source at Emotiq. We want our community to feel part of the project - so our door is always open. Anybody can examine our code and examine the inner workings of Emotiq, and we encourage everybody to do so.</p>
                                    <p>Being open source is vitally important for building up trust in the Emotiq blockchain. Without trust, we might as well pack our bags and go home. The only way we can develop our users’ confidence in the security and reliability of the software is to throw the doors wide open and let everybody examine it for themselves. Open source software also promotes innovation, education, quality, and freedom.  Running a decentralized ecosystem on centralized software doesn’t sit right with us.</p>

                                <div class="faq-list--item-content">
                                    <p>Absolutely!  Child tokens are Emotiq’s equivalent of Ethereum’s ERC20 tokens, which have underpinned the vast majority of recent ICOs. Child tokens provide the same functionality and flexibility, yet because they exist on the Emotiq blockchain, they inherit Emotiq’s speed, scalability, and privacy. Emotiq will also have a decentralized exchange built in, allowing for instant liquidity. If you’re thinking of launching your project and want to ensure that the underlying blockchain can handle what you want it to do without being crippled by performance factors beyond your control, then you’re in the right place.</p>

                                    <p>Yes. Emotiq will support smart contracts and child tokens, and can therefore be used in exactly the same way as any other smart blockchain. The limit will soon be your own imagination, not the limit of the underlying technology. Unlike most other blockchains, with Emotiq, you will no longer have to worry about whether the platform you’re building upon can handle your needs. If you can think of a use for a blockchain, then Emotiq will provide a solid foundation that can deliver the performance you crave.</p>

                                    <p>Joel Reymont, the CEO of Emotiq, will be responsible for Emotiq’s technical vision during its formative months. Once the mainnet is stable, blockchain governance will be migrated to those holding EMTQ. Joel’s focus will then shift to developing the Emotiq ecosystem by seeking out opportunities and partnerships that will benefit the platform and help it mature into what we hope will be one of the next decade’s top blockchains. Joel is the mastermind behind Emotiq, and his focus will remain firmly on bringing his unique vision to reality. Don’t worry - he’s not going anywhere else!</p>

                                    <p>To be perfectly candid, we don’t need them right now. It’s no secret that most “blockchain advisors” don’t add anything of substance whatsoever. They lend their profile to the company to make it seem legit in return for a large payment, because that’s what investors want to see. We’re not playing that game; it’s insulting to our users’ intelligence, and it’s a waste of our investors’ money. We are bringing on advisors who can actually advise, and we’re liaising with multiple universities and expert software engineers to access their unique skills and experience. Besides, take a look at our development team. Any single one of them has more experience than most blockchain teams put together.

Obviously, developing the platform comes first. But developing the community comes a close second, and there’ll be plenty of opportunities to hear some of the team speak at conferences across the globe.

                                    <p>OmniLedger is a protocol for sharding a blockchain, outlined in a paper written by researchers at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland. It represents the state of the art when it comes to scalability.  Unlike most technical papers, it’s not a particularly difficult paper to get through; give it a try!  https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/406.pdf</p>

                                    <p>Not in the slightest. While some blockchains take a semi-centralized approach to sharding, specifically in determining which nodes are in control of how the network shards, Emotiq utilizes a Proof-of-Stake algorithm which randomly determines which nodes are in control. This unpredictability ensures that the Emotiq network is never centralized, and thus operates fairly for all participants.</p>

                                    <p>Lisp is about as powerful and flexible as languages come. It’s been proven over many decades, and remains part of an elite set of languages that are used for high-performance applications. Sure, it’s not the flavor of the month and it’s not what the “cool kids” are learning about in their online coding courses, but our programmers aren’t “cool”; they’re real life virtuoso computer scientists with poor dress sense, gray hair, a distinct lack of tattoos, and decades of hardcore experience working on some of the most advanced projects ever undertaken. They can do things with Lisp that make the average coder gasp in amazement.</p>
                                    <p>Blockchains are complex pieces of technology. They require lots of very complicated programming, difficult mathematics, and experience to piece it all together. Lisp gives Emotiq’s developers the flexibility to nail the task with the utmost control over the finer details, producing a blockchain that will outperform the competition.</p>

                                <div class="faq-list--item-content">
                                    <p>Absolutely.  Oracles are the means by which data enters the blockchain. Without oracles, the blockchain is essentially isolated from the outside world and smart contracts are, well, not smart.</p>
                                    <p>Emotiq envisions the development of a wide variety of oracles, each supplying specific data into the blockchain.  Smart contracts can connect with whatever oracles they need to obtain the data they need, and oracles will receive payment for supplying that data.</p>
                                    <p>Will Emotiq’s oracles be complex and expensive systems that try very hard - and always fail - to eliminate the concept of trust (i.e., how can the blockchain trust that the data supplied by the oracles is trustworthy)? No. The issue of trust is one that people have to decide for themselves. While other oracle systems tie themselves in knots trying to solve the trust issue through all manner of convoluted and inefficient algorithms that merely kick the trust can down the road, Emotiq will keep it simple and allow simple economics to provide a sensible level of trust, just like humans have done for thousands of years. In essence, proven-trustworthy oracles will generate an income by providing high quality data, while unreliable or dishonest oracles will be shunned.</p>

                                    <p>Solidity is difficult to use. Even coders with extensive Solidity experience make mistakes. Expensive mistakes which result in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars worth your cryptocurrency with zero consequences to the people who messed it up. A badly-designed programming language is fine for, say, the software that runs your robotic vacuum cleaner.  Not so much for systems looking after people’s money.</p>
                                    <p>Part of the problem is that people can’t understand Solidity just by looking at it. Errors and loopholes are often almost invisible and therefore overlooked. And to outsiders who can’t code, there’s no hope of being able to decipher exactly what they’re entrusting to store their hard-earned cash.</p>
                                    <p>Enter Ring. By writing smart contracts in natural language (pretty close to English), everybody - even non-programmers - will be able to see exactly how the smart contract works, and mistakes will be easier to see and correct before they cause any harm.</p>

                                    <p>No. Turing complete languages can have infinite loops, which will require a way of being stopped before they clog up the network. Ethereum solves this problem with ‘gas’; when the gas runs out, the processing stops. Emotiq avoids the problem altogether by avoiding infinite loops in the first place.</p>
                                    <p>Are non Turing complete languages any less capable? Not in any practical sense, no. And they come with advantages extremely useful in smart contract applications, such as being far easier to analyze.</p>

                                    <p>Extremely. For those users who speak basic English, Ring will look very familiar. If you can string a basic sentence together and think through a problem logically - two skills that most people have learned by the time they go to high school - then you’ll find using Ring very simple indeed.</p>

                                    <p>You can. Or you can code your smart contracts in Lisp. Or Solidity. Emotiq will support all three.  Lisp for the programmers, Solidity for, ahem, “programmers”, and Ring for those who aren’t programmers at all. You can also write oracles in Lisp, make them accessible to Ring developers, and make money by providing real-world data to the blockchain.</p>

                                    <p>Yes, there was a very early seed round in 2017 to generate the funds to take Joel’s initial ideas and allow him to form Emotiq AG (the company building Emotiq), hire developers, and start work. The risk was immense, and $2,000,000 was raised through the sale of 15% of EMTQ, a token price of $0.013. But as with the private sale, these tokens are locked - 100% for one year - so they absolutely cannot interfere with the market.</p>

                                    <p>Absolutely not! EMTQ obtained in the public TGE will be completely unlocked and yours to do whatever you please with.</p>

                                    <p>Exchange listings are out of our control. Emotiq will, however, do whatever it possibly can to ensure that EMTQ is listed on the better exchanges so that EMTQ is a highly-liquid token.</p>

                                    <p>Yes, bounties will be offered. We’re still working through the details of the program, so stay in contact via Telegram, our mailing list, or regularly check the Emotiq website for further details.</p>

                                    <p>For future development needs. Emotiq plans to be around for a very long time, and that costs money. We also plan on rapidly expanding the Emotiq ecosystem, creating partnerships, forging connections, assisting in the development of third party uses for the network, and ensuring that Emotiq thrives following the public TGE.</p>

                                    <p>For immediate development needs, including hiring more world-class Lisp developers, expanding the business development team, and ensuring that the mainnet is successfully released as soon as possible. We have aggressive goals to reach in terms of platform development and promotion, and these don’t come cheap. </p>

                                    <p>Not quite. ICOs are downmarket and generally linked to some very flimsy Ethereum-based “businesses”. Our TGE, on the other hand, is a high-end distribution of tokens for a world-class core blockchain project.</p>
